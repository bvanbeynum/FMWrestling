			<h2>Varsity</h2>
			<p>
				The varsity wrestling program is one of the top wrestling programs in the state, with a
				long tradition of excellence that is established as a dominant force in high school wrestling.
				Our varsity athletes not only compete to win championships but also to honor those who have
				come before them and to inspire those who will follow in their footsteps. They embody the
				spirit of our school and community, representing us with integrity, passion, and a fierce
				determination to succeed.
			</p>
			<p>
				Our varsity wrestlers have the opportunity to catch the attention of college recruiters and
				earn scholarships based on their exceptional performance. We have a track record of our
				athletes continuing their wrestling careers at the collegiate level, showcasing the caliber
				of talent and dedication that our program nurtures.

		<div className="box">
			<h2>Recreation</h2>
			<p>
				Our recreation wrestling program is specifically designed for young athletes in 6th grade
				and younger, providing a safe and welcoming introduction to the exciting world of wrestling.
				Our experienced coaches work closely with each wrestler, focusing on fundamental techniques,
				coordination, and agility, through engaging and age-appropriate drills and exercises. Wrestlers
				have the opportunity to train and interact with their peers, fostering friendships and building
				a sense of community within our program. While there may be friendly matches and demonstrations,
				the emphasis remains on skill development and having fun rather than intense competition.
